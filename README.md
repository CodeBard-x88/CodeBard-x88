<p>
  Hello everyone,

I'm a CS Final Year student at FAST NU with a diverse background in software development, currently working across several exciting tech stacks. My journey began with a strong passion for Game Development, and Iâ€™ve gained a year of hands-on experience working with Unity, where Iâ€™ve participated in both game jams and professional projects.

While I remain involved in game development, I'm currently exploring other areas that excite me even more: Web Development and Data Science. My Final Year Project involves building a Semantic Search-Powered B2B Wholesale Marketplace using the MERN Stack, where Iâ€™m developing a platform to improve B2B transactions through intelligent search technologies.

While game development continues to be a part of my skillset, I am currently excited to delve deeper into web technologies and data science and AI/ML to create meaningful and innovative solutions for real-world problems.
