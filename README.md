<h1 align="center">About</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone,

I'm excited to introduce myself as a Junior Game Developer with a strong passion for exploring the realms of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse. With a year of experience in game development under my belt, I've had the pleasure of participating in various game jams, including the recent SOFTEC 2024 Game Jam where my team proudly secured a spot in the top 4. 

While my primary focus lies in game development, I'm equally fascinated by the potential of Web 3.0 and Blockchain technologies. This curiosity seamlessly intertwines with my love for game development, propelling me into the exciting universe of the Metaverse. In the recent event, SOFTEC 2024, I secured first place in the Blockchain Competiton. 

This achievement boosted my confidence, and I am now more confident to surf on the waves of Blockchain and Game development.s
